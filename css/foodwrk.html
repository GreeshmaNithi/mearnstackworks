            <p>The big daddy chickpea spread can be slathered on anything from a burger or baked potato to the
                traditional hot pita bread.
                Veteran preference: more garlic, more better.</p>

                Easterners, however, the origins of falafel are a matter of patriotic interest.

            <p>
                Just when you're ready to declare hummus the best dip on the planet, you find moutabal. Similar to baba
                ghanoush, the dip offers a similar consistency with an eggplant kick. Spiced up with chili, it delivers
                a zing.
